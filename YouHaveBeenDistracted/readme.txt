You Have Been Distracted, TI-84 Style - by RHDevelops

Feel free to edit the code, distribute it, or whatever (read the license that came with this). Just tell your friends I exist. And to visit my YouTube channel! Any bugs that you encounter can be reported in the YouTube comment section: https://youtu.be/3TdcKQgV_gg.

Thank you for downloading the TI-84 version of "You Have Been Distracted"! To view this program on your calculator, follow the instructions below.

Remember to archive important stuff. I'm not responsible for any damage or data loss. Though it never happened to me when I compiled it correctly. Whatever you do, do NOT compile it as an Application. Just don't.

Getting it on your calculator:
1. Download the Axe Parser zip (https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/456/45659.html) and extract the files.
2. Download, install, and run the TI Connect software (https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw).
3. Connect the calculator to the computer and send DISTSRC.8xp and AXE.8xk to the calculator. Disconnect the calculator and close the program when it's done sending.

Compiling:
4. The default amount of times it loops is 10. If you would like to change the amount of times it loops, open the programs menu and edit DISTSRC. Then change the variable I to your desired loop amount. WARNING: Do not make it an obscene amount of times, as there is no exit condition. In plain English, once you run the program, you are under the control of the distraction wizard!
5. Go to the Apps menu and open Axe. Select Compile.
6. Select DISTSRC, make sure it compiles with "No Shell" (use left/right keys if it isn't selected), and wait for it to compile.

Running the program:
7. You should be at the home screen now. Go to the catalog and select the "Asm(" token. Then go to the programs list and select DISTRACT.
8. The audio hookups are not required to run the program, so don't worry if you don't have them. Find speakers or headphones with a 2.5mm jack. (In my case, I used a 2.5mm to 2.5mm cord, then a 2.5mm to 3.5mm converter which then plugged into the speakers.)
9. Press Enter to run the program. Enjoy!



Notes on editing this program: Don't try to make it an application. I didn't make appvars for that. But you can. Or I can, if I ever get to doing it. I tried making it an app and it sorta just hanged when I tried to compile it.
